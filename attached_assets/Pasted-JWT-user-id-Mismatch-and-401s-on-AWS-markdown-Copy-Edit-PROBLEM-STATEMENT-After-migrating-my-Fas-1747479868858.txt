JWT user_id Mismatch and 401s on AWS

🔧 PROBLEM STATEMENT:
After migrating my FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React app (ProbeOps) from Replit to AWS (EC2 + RDS), I am facing **401 Unauthorized errors** immediately after logging in using `admin@probeops.com`.

🧪 ON REPLIT:
✅ Everything works — login, token issuance, and API calls
✅ DB is initialized and the admin user works as expected

🛠 ON AWS:
❌ Login *visually* succeeds but I’m logged out right after
❌ Protected endpoint `/api/history?limit=5` returns 401
❌ Logs show this critical error:

DETAIL: Key (user_id)=(377051) is not present in table "users".
[SQL: INSERT INTO usage_logs (...) VALUES (...)]

🎯 I suspect the `JWT` token still carries a **stale or mismatched `user_id` (377051)`** that doesn't exist in my RDS `users` table.

---

📦 SYSTEM DETAILS:

✅ **Backend logs:**
```text
Database initialization completed: {
  'tiers_initialized': False,
  'users_initialized': {'admin_created': True, 'standard_user_created': True},
  'subscriptions_assigned': False
}
✅ admin@probeops.com is created on container startup.

❌ But token still carries user_id=377051, which does not exist in the AWS DB, hence the FOREIGN KEY VIOLATION when inserting into usage_logs.

📌 WHAT I NEED HELP WITH:

Confirm and regenerate a clean JWT on login using the correct user_id from the current PostgreSQL RDS instance.

Ensure that create_access_token(user) in auth.py is using the correct user.id from DB (and not any hardcoded or stale value).

Provide a Python script or FastAPI-compatible snippet to:

Hash a password (probeopS1@)

Insert admin@probeops.com safely into my current DB with logging enabled

How to reset tokens on frontend if an invalid token is cached (e.g., purge localStorage / sessionStorage)

📂 ARTIFACTS & DATA:

✅ JWT causing issues (decoded via jwt.io):

json
Copy

{
  "sub": 377051,
  "exp": 1716047895,
  ...
}
✅ Expected user ID in AWS DB:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@probeops.com';
-- Returns different ID like 1 or 2 (NOT 377051)
🙏 Please help verify the cause, update the token logic if needed, and guide me on cleaning frontend state + aligning DB IDs during migration.

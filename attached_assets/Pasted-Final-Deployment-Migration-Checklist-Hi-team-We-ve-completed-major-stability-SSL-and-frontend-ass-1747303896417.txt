Final Deployment Migration Checklist
Hi team,
We‚Äôve completed major stability, SSL, and frontend asset propagation fixes in our ProbeOps beta and are now ready for the final production-grade deployment. To avoid previous issues (JWT decoding, cert overwrites, NGINX default page, etc.), please review and ensure the following checklist is strictly followed:

‚úÖ Deployment Summary
Docker Compose with services: backend, frontend, nginx, probe

SSL handled by Certbot, mounted into NGINX via volume at /etc/letsencrypt/live/probeops.com-0001/

Frontend assets built during deploy and injected via copy-frontend-assets.sh

Probe node connects over WebSocket (/ws/node) with auth and reconnection logic

.env files separated per service

üîí 1. SSL Certificate Handling
DO NOT overwrite: /etc/letsencrypt/live/probeops.com-0001/*.pem

NGINX is using this exact path for:

ssl_certificate ‚Üí fullchain.pem

ssl_certificate_key ‚Üí privkey.pem

Cert is valid and confirmed:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
issuer=C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = R10
subject=CN = probeops.com
üß± 2. Frontend Asset Management
DO NOT use a volume for frontend/dist in production Docker Compose

Instead, please ensure:

copy-frontend-assets.sh is executed post-build

Static files land correctly in /usr/share/nginx/html within the NGINX image

Marker file or index.html should be present in built container

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Deployment Scripts and Permissions
Ensure the following files are present and executable:

deploy.sh

copy-frontend-assets.sh

verify-frontend.sh

If any were modified locally, please git restore them and chmod +x

üßº 4. Git Working Directory Cleanliness
Run the following before pulling or redeploying to avoid stash/merge errors:

bash
Copy
Edit
git restore deploy.sh
git clean -fd
‚úÖ 5. Post-Deployment Test Plan
Please validate:

https://probeops.com does NOT show default NGINX page

openssl s_client -connect probeops.com:443 -servername probeops.com returns Let's Encrypt issuer, not self-signed

/api/diagnostics/ping?target=google.com returns valid JSON (not 404)

ProbeOps AWS Migration – JWT & Foreign Key Issue

## 🔧 Problem Statement

After migrating my FastAPI + PostgreSQL + React app (ProbeOps) from Replit to AWS (EC2 + RDS), I am facing **401 Unauthorized errors** immediately after logging in with `admin@probeops.com`.

### ✅ On Replit:
- Login works
- API responses work
- Token is valid, user is present in DB

### ❌ On AWS:
- Login appears to succeed, but I am **immediately logged out**
- Protected API endpoint `/api/history?limit=5` returns `401 Unauthorized`
- Backend logs show:

```text
DETAIL: Key (user_id)=(377051) is not present in table "users".
[SQL: INSERT INTO usage_logs (...) VALUES (...)]
📌 Root Cause Suspected
admin@probeops.com is re-created on AWS but likely with a new auto-incremented user ID

The JWT still contains a stale user_id = 377051 from Replit environment

As a result, the backend fails to insert into usage_logs due to foreign key constraint and eventually returns 401

✅ System Logs Snapshot
From Docker logs on AWS:

text
Copy
Edit
Database initialization completed: {
  'tiers_initialized': False,
  'users_initialized': {'admin_created': True, 'standard_user_created': True},
  'subscriptions_assigned': False
}
So the user is created — but token still maps to a missing user_id.

Decoded JWT (via jwt.io):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "sub": 377051,
  "exp": 1716047895
}
DB check on AWS:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'admin@probeops.com';
-- Returns ID = 1 (or something else, NOT 377051)
🔍 What I Need Help With
🔄 Ensure that create_access_token() in auth.py generates a token using the correct user.id from current DB (not stale data or session)

🧪 Provide a working Python snippet or FastAPI method to:

Hash the password probeopS1@

Insert admin@probeops.com into the PostgreSQL RDS DB

Ensure that this record is valid and usable for login + logging

🔁 How to clean frontend token state (e.g. force logout, clear localStorage/sessionStorage) to avoid using stale JWT from Replit

✅ Confirm that usage_logs.user_id foreign key error will be resolved by aligning JWT.sub to actual users.id in AWS DB

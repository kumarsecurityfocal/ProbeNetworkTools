Hi Replit team, now that core functionality is solid, I’d love your help in transforming **ProbeOps** into a clean, professional product with an interface inspired by Airtable (screenshot references attached).

✅ ✨ Design Style Goal: Similar to [Airtable](https://airtable.com)
- Soft pastel backgrounds
- Rounded cards and containers
- Light gradients with depth
- Clean, minimal fonts and whitespace
- Elegant use of color for data visualization

---

### 🎯 Here's What I'd Like to Achieve

#### 1. 🌈 **Logo & Branding**
- Please design a **simple and colorful logo** like Airtable’s — something that reflects "probe", "network", or "operations".
- Use a **primary accent color** (e.g., electric blue or teal) for buttons and highlights.

#### 2. 🧩 **Layout & Navigation**
- Fixed top navbar with logo + route tabs (Dashboard, Diagnostics, Keys, History, Account)
- Left sidebar or dashboard-style panel (optional)
- Responsive layout that scales beautifully on desktop & mobile

#### 3. 📊 **Dashboard Components**
- Use **rounded card UI** with icons and numbers, similar to Airtable’s "workspace" cards
- Add Lucide or Heroicons for diagnostics (Ping, Traceroute, DNS, etc.)
- Include CTA buttons like “Run Probe”, “Add API Key” in dashboard tiles

#### 4. 📈 **Data Visuals**
- Replace raw text output with components like:
  - Pie charts (diagnostic type usage)
  - Line/Bar charts (probe history)
  - Compact tiles for rate limits / API usage

#### 5. 💻 **Login / Auth Pages**
- Design the login and registration screens with:
  - Clean layout
  - Gradient or soft color background
  - Centered form in rounded card

#### 6. 📁 **File Structure**
- Keep reusable components like `<CardTile />`, `<StatsPanel />`, `<IconButton />`, etc.

### 🧪 Optional Enhancements
- Add light/dark toggle (Tailwind)
- Hover animation on cards
- Toast notifications using Radix UI or similar
- Logo in favicon and login page

---

🔗 I’ve attached screenshots of Airtable’s homepage, dashboard, and sidebar to guide the design.

Please go ahead and apply a full UI upgrade based on this — feel free to reorganize Tailwind config, branding colors, or add animations if helpful.

Thanks so much 🙏

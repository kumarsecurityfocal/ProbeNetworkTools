1. Hero Section (Top Fold)
Headline:
🚀 API-First Network Diagnostics — Built for AI Agents & Automation

Subheading:
Trigger Ping, DNS, Traceroute, or WHOIS with a simple API call.
Get JSON results instantly — for DevOps workflows, LLM agents, and monitoring systems.

CTAs:

🔵 “Start Free with 3 Probes”

⚙️ “Explore the API”

Visual:
Animated chart or mock dashboard with JSON output. Optional toggle to show curl request + response.

2. The Problem We Solve (Before/After Format)
❌ Without ProbeOps:
“Why did curl timeout on prod?”

“Why is DNS breaking but I have no logs?”

“My AI agent says ‘API failed’ — but why?”

✅ With ProbeOps:
Run structured probes via API or GUI

Parse JSON responses in agents or scripts

Visualize status in dashboards

Schedule checks or run instantly

3. Who Is It For? (Use Case Tiles)
🧠 AI Agents / LLM Workflows
Run probes as part of Langchain or Flowise actions

🛠️ DevOps & SREs
Add diagnostics into GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.

🔁 Automation Engineers
Use in n8n, Make, Zapier — get structured data back

🖥️ Manual Testing Teams
Use GUI to run ad-hoc probes without writing code

4. Key Features Section
Use card or grid layout — each with an icon and short text:

✅ JSON Output for All Diagnostics

🧠 AI Agent-Ready Endpoints

🔐 API Key Auth + Rate Limits

🕒 Probe Intervals: 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d

✍️ Manual Probe via GUI (Yes, users can also click to test) 👈 Highlight this

📊 Usage Stats & History

# ProbeOps Frontend-Backend Integration Fix

## Date: May 18, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical issues affecting the connection between the React frontend and FastAPI backend, causing 404 errors on multiple platform pages and ghost UI behavior where the frontend appeared to work even when the backend was down.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Backend Connection and Proxy Enhancements

**File: `server.js`**
- Implemented proper HTTP proxy middleware to correctly forward all API requests to the backend
- Added backend readiness checks with retry logic to ensure proper connectivity
- Implemented health check endpoint and monitoring for better reliability
- Fixed double `/api` prefix handling in URL paths
- Added detailed error reporting and graceful degradation when backend unavailable
- Enhanced token validation and forwarding to ensure proper authentication

### 2. Frontend API Configuration Fix

**File: `frontend/src/services/api.js`**
- Fixed the baseURL configuration to eliminate duplicate `/api` prefix:
```javascript
// Old configuration (causing double /api prefix)
baseURL: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? `${window.location.origin}/api` // For production
  : 'http://localhost:8000', // For development

// Fixed configuration
baseURL: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
  ? `${window.location.origin}` // For production - removed /api prefix to avoid duplication
  : 'http://localhost:8000', // For development
```

### 3. Backend Logging Configuration Fix

**File: `backend/logging_config.json`**
- Fixed invalid access formatter that was causing error: `ValueError: Formatting field not found in record: 'client_addr'`
- Updated the access log format to use standard fields available in log records
- Ensured compatibility with Uvicorn and FastAPI standard logging

## Affected Pages Now Working
- API Tokens page
- Schedule Probe page
- Admin Panel (Users/Tiers)
- Probe Management
- User Authentication persistence

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
The proper authentication flow now works as follows:
1. Frontend sends request to Express server
2. Express forwards request with proper authorization headers to FastAPI
3. FastAPI validates token and returns data
4. Express passes response back to frontend

### Readiness Check Implementation
- Express Server checks if FastAPI backend is ready before forwarding requests
- Implements retry logic with 15 attempts (2-second intervals)
- Auto-reconnects when backend becomes available
- Provides clear error messages during backend unavailability

### Logging Improvements
- Fixed improper logging format that was causing errors
- Added more detailed logging for request/response cycles
- Enhanced error reporting with full stack traces in development

### Deployment Considerations
- The Express server must start before or concurrently with the frontend
- The FastAPI backend can start after Express, as the Express server will wait for it
- No manual intervention required - system will self-heal when components become available

## Testing Procedure
To verify the fix is working:
1. Visit `/api-tokens` page and check if API tokens load
2. Try creating a new token and verify it appears in the list
3. Check the Schedule Probe page for proper functionality
4. Verify admin panel access and functionality

# ProbeOps Docker Architecture Questions

To properly diagnose and fix the authentication issues in your Docker environment, I need some specific information about your setup:

1. **Docker Compose Structure**
   - What services are defined in your docker-compose.yml?
   - Which service is responsible for the Express server/frontend proxy?
   - What is the name of your backend FastAPI service?

2. **Network Configuration**
   - How are the containers networked together?
   - Are you using docker network aliases?
   - What hostnames do containers use to communicate with each other?

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Is the authentication token generated by the Express server or the FastAPI backend?
   - Where is the JWT secret stored and shared between services?

4. **Specific Error Messages**
   - What specific error messages do you see in the logs when authentication fails?
   - Do you have any logs from the Express server when login attempts fail?

5. **File and Container Locations**
   - Where is the Express server code located within your container?
   - Is the Express server using a volume mount for its code?

6. **Environment Variables**
   - What environment variables are set for the Express container?
   - Is there a JWT_SECRET environment variable set in the container?

Providing these details will help me create a solution that precisely addresses your specific Docker setup without making incorrect assumptions.
